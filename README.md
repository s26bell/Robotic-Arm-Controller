# Robotic-Arm-Controller
Built an Integrated Circuit using VHDL and Quartus Prime that can in theory maneuver and control a robotic arm. The robotic arm can be moved and extended to a specified (x,y) position. Once the desired position is reached the IC will allow the extender feature to be enabled for the user. If the robotic arm is extended then the a feature allowing the arm to grab objects can be used. If any attempt is made to move the robot to new target position while the arm is extended, an error LED will turn on and it will remain active until the arm is fully retracted. Subcomponents were created for the Integrated Chip for multiple of the operations described above using bit shifters, counters, latches, logic gates & a mealy machine.
